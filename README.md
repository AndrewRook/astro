This repo has astronomy related code that I've used in my work which may be useful for other
researchers. Note that, while as a general principle I try to make my
code readable and fairly well-commented, the data in this repo was not
originally designed to be used by other people. As a result it's
possible that there are confusing bits and subtle bugs, so USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK. Feel free to get in touch with me if you need help and/or
find a problem, but I can't guarantee support on any kind of timely
schedule (or indeed, any schedule at all). Good luck!
