This repo has astronomy related code that I've used in my work which may be useful for other
researchers. Note that, while as a general principle I try to make my
code readable and fairly well-commented, the data in this repo was not
originally designed to be used by other people. As a result it's
possible that there are confusing bits and subtle bugs, so USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK. Feel free to get in touch with me if you need help and/or
find a problem, but I can't guarantee support on any kind of timely
schedule (or indeed, any schedule at all). Similarly, If you do find some use out
of my code, I'd love to hear about it. If it results in a publication
an acknowledgement and/or link to the relevant piece(s) of code would
also be nice.

Good luck!
